Barebones Fastify server with auto-generated docs (Swagger) and client (React Query). Very clean.

# Backend

Basic example server is in `src/app.ts`.

Set up using `npm install`.

Run the server using `npm run dev`. Go to `localhost:4000/docs` to view the docs.

Generate the react query client by running `npm run generateclient`. Edit the location of the generated client in `generate-client.ts`.
